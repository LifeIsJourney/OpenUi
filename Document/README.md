Open Sampel scene. there is a single ui-manager object that controls which menu type should be loaded as main menu.
We have two major kinds of ui elements. Window and Modal. A window is used for each state of your app/game while a modal is shown inside each window.
you can not see more than one window at a time but you can see any number of modals in each window.
ie1: You want to show a popup to user and ask "Are you sure? Yes/No" in shop, in this scenario, popup is a modal and shop menu is Window.
ie2: You want to show coin count both in main menu and shop, you can put coin ui elements inside main menu and shop menu separately, but the best approach is to have a single coin-modal and use it in every place you want. so when coin elements need a change, you only change it once in its own modal.
